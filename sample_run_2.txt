Sample Run Explanation:
During this Sample Run, we tried to make our character, test 2, win by reaching
Planet Python. We set planet python to be on position 3 and roll the die for the 
first move. After landing on position 2 we choose for our character to move 1
position to end up on planet 3/ Planet Python. After winning we wanted our
character to lose by running out of turns. We chose for the character to have 2
moves to complete the game and after 2 moves the game displayed the message 
"You ran out of turns and can no longer continue on your quest.
